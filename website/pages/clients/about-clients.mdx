# Clients

<Callout type="warning">
  This information is relevant for developers who want to create their own `client` to connect to a remote AI. Please
  take a look at the pre-built clients in the Clients section if you are looking for a ready to use client to use in
  your application ([like this one for OpenAI](/clients/open-ai)).
</Callout>

## Description

A `client` connects your application to a remote AI. It is a simple class that you can use to send text based requests _(prompts)_ to the AI and receive plain text responses.

A `client` is used by one or more instances of `prompter` to send text requests to the AI and receive text responses.

## The `client` interface

```typescript
export interface GPTypedClient {
  /**
   * Sends a prompt to the GPT service using a connector to a LLM remote service.
   *
   * @param {string} prompt - The prompt to send to the LLM service.
   * @returns {Promise<string>} - A Promise that resolves to the generated text response from the LLM model.
   */
  sendPrompt(prompt: string): Promise<string>
}
```

A class that implements the `GPTypedClient` interface has to implement the `sendPrompt` method, which has a single parameter: the prompt to send to the LLM service. It will asynchronously return the generated text response.

It is a `client` responsibility to handle the communication with the LLM (AI) service, send the request and return the generated text response.
