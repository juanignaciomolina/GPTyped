# Build & Deploy

## Node package

Here is a list of useful commands for building and testing out GPTyped locally.

- `npm run build` - Build the package
- `npm run build:watch` - Build the package in watch mode
- `npm run lint` - Lint the package
- `npm run format` - Format the package to comply with Prettier

### Release process

Releases are handled through a Github Action. To release a new version, a new Github release is created and then the action will automatically publish the package to NPM.

Versioning is handled through the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standar. The Git tags used by Github and npmjs.com are generated using the [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-version) command.

- `npm version patch` - To bump the version as a patch: `x.x.2`
- `npm version minor` - To bump the version as a patch: `x.2.x`
- `npm version major` - To bump the version as a patch: `2.x.x`
