# Prompters

<Callout type="info">
  This information is relevant for developers who want to create their own `prompter` that build requests for the AI to
  generate a specific kind of response. Please take a look at the pre-built prompters in the Prompters section if you
  are looking for a ready to use `prompter` to use in your application ([like this one for type-safe
  objects](/prompters/prompter-for-object)).
</Callout>

## Description

A `prompter` is a class that builds a text request _(prompt)_ to send to the AI to generate a specific kind of response and validate that the response has the desired structure. A `prompter` may be used to generate responses that return structured values, like JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, etc.

It is only responsable of generating the prompt and validating the generated response by the AI.

It doesn't handle the communication with the AI or is even aware of which AI is being used. For this objective, it relies on a [`client`](/clients/about-clients) to send the prompt and receive the response.

## The `prompter` interface

```typescript
export interface Prompter {
  /**
   * Sends a structured input to the Prompter and returns a promise that resolves to the expected response object.
   * @function
   * @template ResponseObject - The type of the response object.
   * @param {object} input - The object input to be sent to the Prompter.
   * @returns {Promise<ResponseObject>} - A promise that resolves with a type safe response object.
   */
  send<ResponseObject>(input: object): Promise<ResponseObject>
}
```

A class that implements the `Prompter` interface must implement the `send` method. This method receives an object as input and returns a promise that resolves to a type safe response object.

Please note the `ResponseObject` type. This type is used to define the type of the response object that the `send` method will return.
